The Monero network will be going through a scheduled update at height
2210000 which will approximately be on the 17th of October 2020. If you
are not on daemon version v0.17.0.0 after the upgrade, you will be left
on the old chain until you upgrade.

This network upgrade does not bring any PoW changes with it, so mining
software like net-misc/xmrig need not be upgraded.
